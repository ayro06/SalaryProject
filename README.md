# SalaryProject
A small C# application that takes in a csv with employees, hourly rate, hours worked &amp; visa status, which then calculates the tax &amp; net pay accordingly &amp; exports it into another csv with all the details.
<br>The raw .csv data can be found in the import folder.
<br>You'll need to install/restore CcvHelper NuGet Package in order to run this program.
<br>NUnit testing is optional.
